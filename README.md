# Blog Management System
The Blog Management System is a Windows Forms application built using C# and Entity Framework. It allows users to manage blog data, including authors, posts, and categories. Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the blog data through a user-friendly graphical interface.

Features :

. Double-click on a row in any data grid to load the selected item's information into the input fields for editing.

. Add new authors, posts, and categories by providing relevant details and clicking the "Add" button in the respective sections

. Update author, post, and category details by selecting a row in the corresponding data grid, making changes in the input fields, and clicking the "Update" button

. Delete an author, post, or category from the system by selecting a row in the respective data grid and clicking the "Delete" button. A confirmation prompt will appear before the deletion is executed

. The application uses Entity Framework to interact with the underlying database and performs data operations.
